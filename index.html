          Environmentally Friendly homewares'.

          <h2>Richard</h2>
          <p>
            I'm a property entrepreneur who has renovated many houses as well as
            being a landlord. Before ModEco Vanessa and I owned and ran a
            boutique hotel in France for eleven years. Project management is
            generally ‘my thing’, whilst relying on Vanessa’s design skills.
          </p>
          <h2>Vanessa</h2>
          <p>
            I studied at the London college of fashion and was a fashion
            designer for many years. I then turned to designing the interiors of
            the houses that we renovated, eventually leading to my largest
            renovation project to date - 'Maison de Plumes', which was a French
            17th Century Chateau that we purchased back in 2009. This was a two
            year renovation project. Each room was themed around a particular
            bird wallpaper. These included the Flamingo, Ostrich, Parakeet and
            Peacock rooms as well as the stunning Swan suite. The house and
            business were featured in many international 'Top 10' lists,
            including The Times & Le Figaro.

      <h2>Today</h2>
      <p>
        Taking into account our previous careers, designing patterns for use on
        mediums like home-wares was a natural progression. We work alongside
        talented artists, illustrators and photographers, some of the best in
        their field. From this we are able to offer you unique, design led and
        exclusive products that presently include wallpaper, murals, cushions
        and furniture.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Eco Ethos</h2>
      <p>
        We have always recycled/up-cycled as we believe in creating as little
        waste as possible. This mantra has been carried through every business
        we have ever owned. Our name says it all.

      <h2>Our wallpaper and Murals</h2>
      <p>
        We have always recycled/up-cycled as we believe in creating as little
        waste as possible. This mantra has been carried through every business
        we have ever owned. Our name says it all.

      <h2>Our Cushions</h2>
      <p>
        We use only 'Eco' Cotton and Vegan friendly faux suede as fabrics. We
        use a 'print on demand' company to produce our cushion covers which
        again means less waste than buying fabric on a roll.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Furniture</h2>
      <p>
        We purchase old and unloved pieces and give them a new lease of life. We
        clean, paint and then decoupage our stunning designs onto them. They
        then become a one off statement piece that will add some serious style
        into any room where they are placed!
